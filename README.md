# Rowing Game
by Teddy Clark

A simple infinite runner made with Java.

The player controls a boat and must avoid the beach and obstacles in order to make it as far as possible. The game speeds up as you get further. You can collect health packs along the way to restore health or to increase max health.

The game also has themes which can change the color of the game and the sprite of the boat.
